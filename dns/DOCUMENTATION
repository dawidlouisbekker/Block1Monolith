1. Recursive Resolver
Checks cache. Domains IP address time in cache depends on TTL.

2. Root Name Server
Contains the IP addresses of the servers for certain TLD (.com)

3. Query to TLD Name Server (.com)
The recursive resolver then asks the TLD Name Server where example.com is located.
The TLD Name Server does NOT have the actual IP but knows which Authoritative Name Server is responsible for example.com.
It responds with the address of example.comâ€™s Authoritative Name Server.

4. Query to Authoritative Name Server
The recursive resolver now asks the Authoritative Name Server for example.com (which is managed by the website owner or their hosting provider).
The Authoritative Name Server looks up its DNS records and responds with the actual IP address of example.com.

5. Recursive Resolver Caches and Returns the Answer
The Recursive Resolver caches the answer for a certain period (based on the TTL setting).
It then sends the final IP address back to your device.
Your browser uses this IP to connect to the website's server and load the page.

The IP address and the domain name is added to the Authoritative Name Server for the TLD.
